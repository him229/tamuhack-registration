# tamuhack-registration

The goal of this tool is to provide a single application that will help us better organize and improve TAMUhack for participants in 2017 and the future.

The focus is on registration and creating a product that will store information in a NoSQL database, will move registration information into the database, and have an accessible frontend for viewing information.


### Future Extensions

We are considering expanding this tool to manage volunteer signups and judging.
