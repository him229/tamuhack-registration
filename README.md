### bark: The world's loudest and proudest hackathon registration system

Bark was originally used at [TAMUhack](https://www.tamuhack.com) and is used for quick and easy applicant reviewing. The goal of this tool is to provide a single application that will better organize and the applicant workflow without the need for a heavy duty, applicant facing web application. Via typeform, applicants input their information, data is sent to bark, and hackathon organizers have a trivial interface to review prospective hackers.
