If I were to have unlimited resources, I want to be able to use my full advantage and build something for everyone to use. Something to use on the daily, easily, and does not require much input. For example, an application for a daily schedule based on daily routines and current data from users.  Or even something as simple as improving upon current ideas that are already on the rise. There is so much to do with unlimited resources, but always important to use them in a team. ","What I would like to win at TAMUhack is of course of the top prizes. However being my first hackathon, I mainly want to go for the experience of working in teams overnight and the greatest prize from that is what you learn from others. I have heard a lot about getting the chance to meet people across the state or even further and share ideas with them. I also heard about the small prizes and free goodies that are provided which is always great :) "

However, I believe that having a presence on and knowledge of these platforms will be very beneficial to my future career and shows my initiative to be involved in tech. Also, besides the programming projects I've done for school assignments, I'm currently working on a personal project to help my mom with her business concerning the transaction process. It's a very basic program with simple and plain GUI that calculates the total retail amount of phone top-up cards sold to each customer. In addition to price calculation, the program also has a feature where users can set the rate or customize the unit price for each variation of phone cards (1$, 2$, 5$, 10$...etc) as the prices change from day to day.","Programmer A: How would you rate the performance of my program?Programmer B: C++ .","I'm assuming that by having 'unlimited resources', I can build something with features that are only limited by my own imagination. So, how about an AI-powered robot that can transform into just about any autonomous forms (including but not limited to car, plane, boat), answer any burning questions we have about particular matters and create anything we ask it to (camera, phone, food, first-aid kits ....etc). That way, tons of problems will be solved and the needs of everyone from every walk of life will be met without any complications. PS, having the ability to detect ill-intentioned people and avoid them is a must-have feature for the robot!  ","If I and my team made it as the top hackers, it'd be really cool if we could go on a trip together to have some fun as well as further develop our project to its fullest potential!
